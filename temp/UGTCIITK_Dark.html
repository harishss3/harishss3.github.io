<div><h1 style="color:#1abc9c"><center>A breif guide to types of courses at IITK</center></h1>

<p><b style="color:#e74c3c">Disclaimer</b>: This article is solely meant as an unofficial reference. Though I have tried to make sure that the information is correct, I claim no accuracy of the same. Always consult official sources like the UG Manual, DOAA Website, etc. The ongoing pandemic situation and shifting of the semester to online mode might also lead to changes. I would also be grateful for any suggestions/feedback/corrections.</p>

<p>We won't be discussing about Minors, Double Major and Dual Degree in this article for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<h3 style="color:#f1c40f">Credits</h3>
<p>Credits denote the weightage of a course. A course worth more credits is likely to have a heavier workload(the term is quite subjective, but you get the general idea). Also, a common miscoception, the credits which a student earns for completing a course are independent of the grade acheived(given that he/she passes the course). That is, if you pass a course worth x credits, you would have completed x credits regardless of the grade you get.<br> (Sidenote : The credits also denote the number of hours in a week the Institute expects you to devote to a given course(including lectures, tutorials, self studt,etc). That is, you are expected to devote 11 hours per week to a course worth 11 credits (we obviously don't do that). This thing generally confuses everybody more than it helps, so you can safely ignore it as a piece of trivia.)</p>

<h3 style="color:#f1c40f">Structure</h3>
<p>Certain minimum number of credits have to be completed to get your degree. Your template will give a breakdown of the number of credits of different types of courses which need to be done. An example might help. Degree requirements for BT CSE is as follows: (Types of courses elaborated below)</p>

<h3 style="color:#f1c40f">Types of Courses</h3>
<p>There are 8 types of courses at IITK - Institute Compulsory(IC), Humanities and Social Science(HSS), Engineering Science Option(ESO), Science Option(SO), Department Compulsory(DC), Department Elective(DE), Open Elective(OE) and Undergraduate Project(UGP). Any course which you take will fall into one of these categories. Note that the same course may fall in different categories for different students. If a particular course falls under more than one category, you have to declare the category beforehand.
<ol>
	<li><b style="color:#e67e22">Institute Compulsory(IC)</b></li>
	These courses are compulsory for all BTech/BS students irrespective of their branch. Normally, these are spread over first four semesters. A list of IC courses can be found <a href="ic_dark.html">here</a>.
	<br><br><li><b style="color:#e67e22">Humanities and Social Science(HSS)</b></li>
	There are two types of HSS courses - Level 1 (worth 11 credits each) and Level 2 (worth 9 credits each). All BT/BS students are required to take two Level 1 and three Level 2 courses to complete their degree requirements. These courses are offered by the HSS and the ECO departments.
	<br><br><li><b style="color:#e67e22">Engineering Science Option(ESO)/Science Option(SO)</b></li>
	As the name suggests, these are a bunch of Engineering/Science courses offered by various departments. All the students have to complete certain minimum number of credits worth of ESO/SOs, which varies across departments but is roughly between 40-45. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cKAwnfXs69_5I-NRGAS1rHmANjWeFgXXX9rwvre2bBY/edit?usp=drivesdk">Here</a> is a nice ppt which explains all the ESO/SO courses in detail. Credits : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CounsellingServiceIitKanpur">Counselling Service, IITK</a>. <br> Generally, your department will require you to take some ESO/SOs as compulsory and for the remaining credits, you can choose from others in the list. Mandatory ESO/SOs can be checked from your department template. An example might help. EE students are required to take at least 44 credits worth of ESO/SOs. Also, MSO201, MSO202a, MSO203b, and ESO203 are mandatory for them. That's 36 credits done already. This means that they have to take one more ESO/SO course (8 credits or more) to complete their ESO/SO credit requirement.
	<br><br><li><b style="color:#e67e22">Department Compulsory(DC)</b></li>
    These are courses offered by your department which are mandatory.Like IC courses, there is no choice for DCs, the only difference is DC courses are department specific(which is kind of obvious from their name).
	<br><br><li><b style="color:#e67e22">Department Elective(DE)</b></li>
    Apart from DC courses, departments offer lots of other courses. A student can choose from the courses being offered by his/her department only as DEs. You have to complete certain minimum credits  worth of DE courses of your choice. In general you can take any course being offered by your department as a DE (apart from the DCs obviously), but for some departments, some DEs are required to be taken only from a certain "basket" of courses.
	<br><br><li><b style="color:#e67e22">Open Elective(OE)</b></li>
    The most interesting of all. They are like DEs with difference being that you are completely free to take <b>any</b> course offered by <b>any</b> department(including your own). This can even include ESO/SOs if your ESO/SO requirement has been completed already. Like DEs, you have to complete certain minimum credits worth of OE courses.(54 in general)
    <br><br><li><b style="color:#e67e22">Undergraduate Project(UGP)</b></li>
    As the name suggests, it involves doing a project under the supervision of a Professor. Four UGPs can be taken out of which UGP1 and UGP4 are optional(i.e. not necessary for degree completion). UGP2 and UGP3 can be replaced by a DE and an OE respectively (in most departments).
